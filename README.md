A simple clone of [Hacker News](https://news.ycombinator.com), built with React, Hooks, React Router, Webpack and TypeScript. It uses the [Hacker News API](https://github.com/HackerNews/API). Has a dark theme implemented with Context.

Is the final exercise of the **React with TypeScript course** of [ui.dev](https://ui.dev).

- Started as the final exercise of the **React course** ([course website](https://ui.dev/react) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/uidotdev/react-course)).
- Then I converted it to hooks at the **React Hooks course** ([course website](https://ui.dev/react-hooks) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/uidotdev/react-hooks-course)).
- Finally, I converted it to TypeScript at the **React with TypeScript course** ([course website](https://ui.dev/react-typescript) and [GitHub repo](https://github.com/uidotdev/react-with-typescript-course)).
